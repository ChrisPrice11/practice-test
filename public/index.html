            <div class="question">
                    Insects are everywhere and
                    they live in all kinds of places. Ants
                    are some insects that live under the ground.
                    Grasshoppers live above the ground in fields. Some
                    kinds of beetles live on or near water but other kinds of
                    beetles live in tree bark. Bees build a hive where they
                    live. Some insects like cockroaches are pests that live
                    in homes and apartments.<br><br>
                    All insects have six legs. Spiders are not insects
                    because they have eight legs.
                    The body of an insect has three parts. The first
                    part is the insect’s head. Like the head of other
                    creatures, an insect’s head is the location of its eyes
                    and mouth. An insect’s mouth is specially designed for
                    the kind of food it eats. Instead of ears insects have
                    two antennae that stick out in front.<br><br>
                    The middle part of an insect is called the thorax.
                    Wings and legs are part of the thorax. The back end of
                    an insect is called the abdomen. An insect’s stomach is
                    in the abdomen.
